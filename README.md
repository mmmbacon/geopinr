This app is a tech demonstration using Node.js, React, Apollo GraphQL, MongoDB Atlas and MaterialUI. Authentication is provided by Google Plus API via OAuth2.0. The app serves as a central hub for skaters of all backgrounds to come together to share skate spots and socialize. Future plans include the ability to add multiple photos per pin, maintain ratings for each pin, and allow sharing of spots via social media like instagram.
